5th sem project

Our project entitled “ AUTOCar ” is an autonomous vehicle that performs image processing on digital images obtained from live webcam in real time to detect lane, obstacle and traffic signs in front of it. The purpose of our project is to build a self driving car that can drive safely on roads. We are using “Raspberry Pi” to process the continuous image derived from “Minoru 3D Webcam”. To process the images we have implemented various mathematical algorithms. After processing the images, the result is implemented using “GPIO pins” to drive the vehicle. We expect this car to avoid accidents using appropriate image processing algorithms. Hence, we have been able to make an obstacle avoiding car which can drive responding to stops signs and traffic lights.
